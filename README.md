# MiniJava Compiler
Using the Visitor Pattern, the compiler performs Semantic Analysis and converts the
MiniJava Code into the intermediate representation (IR) used by the LLVM
compiler project.

## Execution: 
./run.sh <filename.java>

MiniJava files can be found on codegen_java and examples folders.
